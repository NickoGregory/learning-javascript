 // In the lesson we will learn the basics of javascript and build out a pyramid 
 // generator as we following along with freecodecamp lessons.

//  The first lesson to build a pyramid generator is to learn about variables.
// this is often done using let keyword,variable nameing follows a specific rule,
/** names can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores, but cannot 
 * contain spaces and must not begin with a number.

Use the let keyword to declare a variable called character.

Note: It is common practice to end statements in JavaScript with a semicolon. ; */

let character;

// lesson 2.

// this lesson teaches how to assign a value to a variable.
// by using the assignment operator you can assign a value,this is call
// intialization 
// i added the string value of "hello" to the character variable.
let character = "hello";

// lesson 3.

//  this lesson teaches you about the string value
// this specific lesson states that there is 2 ways to write string its by using sigle or double quotes.
// i replaced the double qoutes for the value of the character variable from double to single.
let character = 'hello'

// lesson 4.

// This lesson teaches you about the console.log, this is method with the function to output 
// the value of a variable.
// i added the console.log method to print the value of character variable to the console log.
let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);

// lesson 5.

// this lesson teaces you how to reasign/replace the value of a variable.
// I change the value of the variable from hello to world.
let character = 'Hello';
character= "World"
console.log(character);

// lesson 6.

// This lesson teaches about you how to name varuables using camel case, 
// this means that each word in your name should start with a capital letter. 
// I added a new variable called secondCharacter; without intializing it.
// this is called uninitialized.
let character = 'Hello';
character= "World"
console.log(character);
let secondCharacter;

// lesson 7.

// this lesson teaches you how to assign a value to a unitialized variable.
// i added a value to a unitializled variable.
let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = "World";
let secondCharacter;
secondCharacter = "Test"
console.log(secondCharacter);
